Crypto[well]
</a>

## A React crypto app from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DDX3US3kss">Javascript Mastery </a> . I wanted a fun project to work on and this one included Redux Toolkit for state management, Ant Design for the UI and used CoinRank and Bing news APIs via Rapid API. Also used Chart.js, millify and moment though I may use a lighter weight datetime package or just do it vanilla. Deployed with netlify.
